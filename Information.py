            -  Face Detection Methods 


            Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks - MTCNN

            MTCNN is a framework developed as a solution for both face detection and face alignment. 
            The process consists of three stages of convolutional networks that are able to recognize 
            faces and landmark location such as eyes, nose, and mouth.

            -  Face Recognition Methods 
            

            Histogram of Oriented Gradients - HOG 
            
            HOG is a simple and powerful feature descriptor. It is not only used for face detection 
            but also it is widely used for object detection like cars, pets, and fruits. HOG is robust 
            for object detection because object shape is characterized using the local intensity gradient
            distribution and edge direction.

            Convolutional Neural Net - CNN

            CNN is a type of artificial neural network used in image recognition and processing that is 
            specifically designed to process pixel data. CNNs are powerful image processing, artificial 
            intelligence (AI) that use deep learning to perform both generative and descriptive tasks, 
            often using machine vison that includes image and video recognition, along with recommender 
            systems and natural language processing.
